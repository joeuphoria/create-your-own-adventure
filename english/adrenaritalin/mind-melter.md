very real, these are not the kind of events that take place

in reality". In failed attempts to wake yourself, anxiety's

frozen chill starts climbing up your spine and into your

mind. "Get ahold of yourself, it's just a dream!", you shout,

the sound absorbed by the marshmallow walls. The silence

startles you. Jolts of fight or flight shoot through your

body. The bass drum in your chest becomes fortissimo as

adrenaline takes hold of your nerves. As your thought

processes narrow, you begin to observe the marshmallow.

Awareness kicks you in the teeth as you realize that the

mallow is pulsating! Lips buzzing, chest thumping, tensions

fills your fibers as you reach to to the sticky surface.

Quickly, you poke at the substance and retract back. Nothing.

Nothing happens. Abruptly, the pulsating from the wall

becomes stronger. Sound begins filling the room as strange

fluid starts draining into the room. "Is that music?", you

question. "Ive really lost it now. Is this a stroke?" The

sounds get louder. Every action begins to be the same. "Am I

stuck in some sort of Groundhogs Day?", you mumble to

yourself. You begin to dizzily make your way about the room

as if extremely inebriated. This occupies your mind:
